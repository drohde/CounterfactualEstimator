Just a suggestion, but I think there is room for one more..  maybe it could also be titled the uglyness of reality..

IPS is wonderful because you get an offline metric (ctr) that at least attempts to predict an online metric (ctr)

but I think it would be easy to read this and think it is widely used or even widely useable..  

When does IPS work?

I think the answer is something like:
pi_test(a|X) is zero outside the candidate set - and the candidate set is small.  This means it doesn't matter that pi_0(a|X) is zero for many actions.

a is a single recommendation - not a banner (or a timeline)

What do we do instead?
mean rank
recall@K

It doesn't work at all for sales - because you need to consider whole timelines... yes there is a pandora's box here!!

Part of the point of this is that with offline metrics you are to some extent flying blind and it isn't easy to do something about this...
